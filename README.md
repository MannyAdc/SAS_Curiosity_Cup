## About SAS Curiosity Cup

The Curiosity Cup brings student teams together from across the globe for a competition of real-world analytics skills (link: https://www.sas.com/en_us/offers/21q4/curiosity-cup.html).


## Task / Project Description

Each team were required to choose a topic and dataset for the competition. I as a team member of the students from Australia, Egypt, and Japan have participated into the cup held in January 2022. 

Our team explored the relation between the length of hospital stay and various factors based on the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/nehaprabhavalkar/av-healthcare-analytics-ii. The analysis was held primarily on SAS Studio.


## Topic

During the Covid-19 crisis, health systems in both developed and developing countries have witnessed an unprecedented surge in patients’ inflow. Emergency departments and hospital aisles were being filled with occupied beds. Moreover, many Covid-19 and non-pandemic cases were hindered from accessing healthcare due to hospitals’ overfilled capacity. This strain on hospitals’ capacity is greatly attributed to the uncertainty of prospective inpatient Length of Stay (LOS) for each patient. 

“The Length of Stay (LOS) represents the interval time between the admission of the patient and his discharge.” It is a basic indicator to evaluate the hospitals’ performance and quality of healthcare. Given the hospitals’ objective to achieve maximum utilization of resources along with timely patient care, hospitals work on increasing patients’ flow and abolish the time for non-value added care. Optimal patient flow will not only guarantee effective and efficient care but also minimize the risk of hospital acquired infections and determine the accessibility to inpatient services.

Our project aims to identify LOS predicting factors besides the provision of actionable recommendations to guide health leaders. In case of statistically significant results, our findings will guide efficient use of resources and assist in the preparedness for unexpected surge in demand for hospitals inpatient care. On the other hand, if the investigated LOS connections were not evident, this gives an indication that policy makers should address other LOS predicting factors. To sum up, this project will provide insights on the estimation of LOS at admission time which is necessary for “appropriate planning of care activities”.
